/**
 * You are given two 0-indexed strings word1 and word2.
 * 
 * A move consists of choosing two indices i and j such that 0 <= i <
 * word1.length and 0 <= j < word2.length and swapping word1[i] with word2[j].
 * 
 * Return true if it is possible to get the number of distinct characters in
 * word1 and word2 to be equal with exactly one move. Return false otherwise.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: word1 = "ac", word2 = "b"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Any pair of swaps would yield two distinct characters in the
 * first string, and one in the second string.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: word1 = "abcc", word2 = "aab"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We swap index 2 of the first string with index 0 of the second
 * string. The resulting strings are word1 = "abac" and word2 = "cab", which
 * both have 3 distinct characters.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: word1 = "abcde", word2 = "fghij"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Both resulting strings will have 5 distinct characters,
 * regardless of which indices we swap.
